# Warm-up example for testing any JS code

## Assignment

Write a Regular Expression (RegEx) that recognizes the word "dog".

## Requirements

- Should recognize the word "dog" by itself or within surrounding text.
- Should ignore "dog" as part of another word, e.g. "hotdog."
- Should be case insensitive.

## Approach

Following principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD):

- Turn requirements into automated tests.
- Write just enough code for the tests to run and FAIL.
- Adjust code until all tests pass.

## Coding Time!

Open [Dog-start.test.js](../src/Components/__tests__/Dog-start.test.js) and folow the instructions.

If you get stuck, you can see an example solution in [Dog-done.test.js](../src/Components/__tests__/Dog-done.test.js)
